# SC-12: Cryptographic Key Management

## Implementation Status: Implemented

## Control Statement

The organization establishes and manages cryptographic keys using automated mechanisms with supporting procedures or manual procedures.

## Implementation

### Key Management Framework

1. Key Generation:
   - AWS KMS for key creation
   - FIPS 140-2 validated modules
   - Hardware security modules
   - Automated key rotation

2. Key Distribution:
   - IAM role-based access
   - Encrypted key transport
   - Secure key sharing
   - Cross-account permissions

3. Key Storage:
   - KMS for key storage
   - CloudHSM integration
   - Backup procedures
   - Version control

4. Key Rotation:
   - Automatic annual rotation
   - Manual emergency rotation
   - Version tracking
   - Access logging

### Key Protection Controls

1. Access Management:
   - IAM policies
   - Key policies
   - Grants management
   - Audit logging

2. Key Lifecycle:
   - Creation procedures
   - Usage tracking
   - Rotation schedule
   - Deletion process

3. Compliance Requirements:
   - FIPS 140-2 validation
   - Algorithm standards
   - Key length requirements
   - Usage restrictions

4. Monitoring Tools:
   - CloudWatch metrics
   - CloudTrail logs
   - Security Hub alerts
   - Access analysis

### Monitoring Evidence

```sql
select 
  key_id,
  enabled,
  rotation_enabled,
  case
    when not enabled then 'fail'
    when not rotation_enabled then 'fail'
    else 'pass'
  end as status
from
  aws_kms_key
where
  key_manager = 'CUSTOMER';
```
