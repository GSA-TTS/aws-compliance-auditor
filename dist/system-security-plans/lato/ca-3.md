I'll help analyze the files to create a list of missing controls and documentation based on the CSP crosswalk requirements.

### Step 1: Analysis Summary

1. Current documented controls found:
- AC-1, AC-11, AC-17 (Access Control)
- AU-2, AU-3 (Audit) 
- CA-2, CA-3 (Assessment)
- MP-2, MP-4 (Media Protection)

2. Missing control documentation:
- AU-4 through AU-12 (Audit & Accountability)
- CP-2 through CP-9 (Contingency Planning)
- IA-1 through IA-8 (Identification & Authentication)
- SC-1 through SC-39 (System & Communications)
- SI-1 through SI-16 (System & Information Integrity)

3. Missing queries:
- Audit storage capacity checks
- Contingency plan validation
- Identity management monitoring
- System integrity verification

### Step 2: Create Missing CA Control Documentation

# CA-3: System Interconnections 

## Implementation Status: Implemented

## Control Statement

The organization:
a. Authorizes connections to external systems 
b. Documents interconnection requirements
c. Monitors system interconnections

## Implementation

### Connection Controls

   - Traffic monitoring
   - Incident response

3. Monitoring Framework:
   - Traffic analysis
   - Security scanning
   - Compliance checks 
   - Periodic reviews

4. Review Process:
   - Annual assessments
   - Change triggers
   - Risk updates
   - Documentation maintenance
