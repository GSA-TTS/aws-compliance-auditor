## Implementation Status: Implemented

## Control Statement

The information system:
a. Prevents further access to the system by initiating a session lock after 15 minutes of inactivity or upon receiving a request from a user

## Implementation

Session locking is implemented through:

1. AWS Console settings:
   - Automatic session timeout after 15 minutes
   - Require re-authentication to resume
   - Clear screen on lock

2. EC2 Instance controls:
   - OS-level screen locking
   - Auto-lock on inactivity
   - Password protected unlock

3. RDS Database sessions:
   - Connection timeout settings
   - Idle session termination
   - Re-auth requirements
